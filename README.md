## A study of UF students' carbon footprints on campus

Zero-waste UF was my Design of Experiments (STA4211) final project in Spring 2018. The data I collected was utilized to analyze how demographic factors (gender and year in school) influenced the amount of paper and plastic food-related consumables students throw away on campus weekly. (In a later project, I proposed an incentive system that aimed to reduce students' carbon footprint and analyzed the willingness of students to participate in the program using the same data set.)
